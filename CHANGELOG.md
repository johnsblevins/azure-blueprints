- Updated to the latest set of built-ins at `samples/builtins`
- Updated `build.ps1` and `release.ps1` to use latest powershell modules. A lot less code and assumes the `Az` module is preinstalled, so executions should be much faster 
- Updates `pipelines.yml` to use the latest version of [Neil Peterson's DevOps Pipelines extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=nepeters.azure-blueprints&ssr=false)
- Closed issue `#10` on [github.com/azure/azure-blueprints](https://github.com/azure/azure-blueprints)
